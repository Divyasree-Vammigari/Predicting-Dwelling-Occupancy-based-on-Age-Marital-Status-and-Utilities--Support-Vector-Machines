rented property based on the factors such as age, vehicles, marital status and utilities bills. The data 
for this research is collected from Washington State data collected from US Census has more than 
70000 columns. For analyzing the data Support Vector Machine with different methods like Linear, 
Radial Basis Function and Polynomial Kernel. In this report all the three models are discussed and 
the insights from the analysis are helpful for real estate agents and policymakers to understand 
how factors influenced the dwelling occupancy. 

Performing on the different kernels and cross validating models drew 84 percent of 
accuracy in categorizing the data. The findings provide insights for real estate agents and 
policymakers into housing occupancy patterns and the influence of demographic and housing 
factors on predictions.
